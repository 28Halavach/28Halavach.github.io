          <li>Welcome to English in a Minute.</li>
          <li>
            Every language has weather-related expressions. Two common weather
            conditions are rainy and sunny.
          </li>
          <li>Jonathan, are you comming my Lawn Cary party?</li>
          <li>
            We need to mow the lawn, pull the weeds, and cut down a dead tree.
          </li>
          <li>Of course! I will be there.</li>
          <li>
            You know, you also said you were comming to my Paint My Kitchen
            party and you didn't.
          </li>
          <li>
            This time I will. Come rain or shine. I will be at your place
            Saturday morning!
          </li>
          <li>
            Come rain or shine means something will happen no matter what. It's
            a promise. You can even use the phrase when talking about the actual
            weather. So, if you invite people to an outdoor party, you can tell
            them it will happen, come rain or shine.

          <li>Welcome to English in a Minute.</li>
          <li>
            An individual human hair is very thin. This sounds very hard to do.
            And kind of pointless. Let's listen.
          </li>
          <li>Jonathan, I don't know which notebook to use.</li>
          <li>It's a note book. What's the difference?</li>
          <li>
            Huge defferences! This one has lines. This one does not. This one
            has a spiral binder. This one does not.
          </li>
          <li>Okay, now you're just spliting hairs.</li>
          <li>
            When you "split hairs," you focus on really small and unimportant
            defferences between two or more things. This is a useful expression
            during an argument. If you are arguing with someone over something
            very small, you can say, "Let's not split hairs. It's not worth it."
          </li>
          <li>And that's English in a Minute.</li>

            Many expressions in American English have to do with animals, like
            this one.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hey Jonathan, did you get a chance to go to that new restaurant by
            your apartment?
          </li>
          <li>Oh yeah!</li>
          <li>I pigged out.</li>
          <li>I tried almost every single dish they had.</li>
          <li>The food was that good, huh?</li>
          <li>Sure was.</li>
          <li>
            But next time I decide to try a new restaurant, please remind me to
            not pig out | quite that much!
          </li>
          <li>
            When we say "pig out" about a person, it means that person seems to
            eat as much as a pig does
          </li>
          <li>
            To "pig out" means to eat a lot of something all at once, probably
            more than you should!
          </li>
          <li>And that's English in a Minute.</li>
