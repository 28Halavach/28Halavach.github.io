          <li>Welcome to English in a Minute.</li>
          <li>
            An individual human hair is very thin. This sounds very hard to do.
            And kind of pointless. Let's listen.
          </li>
          <li>Jonathan, I don't know which notebook to use.</li>
          <li>It's a note book. What's the difference?</li>
          <li>
            Huge defferences! This one has lines. This one does not. This one
            has a spiral binder. This one does not.
          </li>
          <li>Okay, now you're just spliting hairs.</li>
          <li>
            When you "split hairs," you focus on really small and unimportant
            defferences between two or more things. This is a useful expression
            during an argument. If you are arguing with someone over something
            very small, you can say, "Let's not split hairs. It's not worth it."
          </li>
          <li>And that's English in a Minute.</li>

            Many expressions in American English have to do with animals, like
            this one.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hey Jonathan, did you get a chance to go to that new restaurant by
            your apartment?
          </li>
          <li>Oh yeah!</li>
          <li>I pigged out.</li>
          <li>I tried almost every single dish they had.</li>
          <li>The food was that good, huh?</li>
          <li>Sure was.</li>
          <li>
            But next time I decide to try a new restaurant, please remind me to
            not pig out | quite that much!
          </li>
          <li>
            When we say "pig out" about a person, it means that person seems to
            eat as much as a pig does
          </li>
          <li>
            To "pig out" means to eat a lot of something all at once, probably
            more than you should!
          </li>
